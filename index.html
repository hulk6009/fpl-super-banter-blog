  <h1>🏆 Super BANTER Liga 3.0 Ends in SHOCK, TEARS & THUNDER!</h1>

  <p>After 38 grueling Gameweeks of captaincy disasters, differential heartbreaks, and the occasional bench boost betrayal, the curtains have finally closed on the chaos that was <strong>Super BANTER Liga 3.0</strong> and what a finish it was!</p>

  <h2>👑 Champion of Chaos: High Tension⚡️ (Mayowa O’tobiloba) – <span class="highlight">2511 points</span></h2>
  <p>Let’s give a standing ovation (or at least a polite slow clap) to <strong>Mayowa O’tobiloba</strong>, whose team <strong>High Tension⚡️</strong> lived up to its name by taking the title with a solid <strong>2511 points</strong>. Legend has it he captained Haaland on every right week and somehow avoided the infamous Luke Shaw "1-point-and-injury" curse.</p>

  <h2>🥈 Dreamz FC� (Dreamz Of Ng) – <span class="highlight">2492 points</span></h2>
  <p>Coming in second with <strong>2492 points</strong> was <strong>Dreamz Of Ng</strong>. He dreamt big, he played hard but in the end, it was a 19-point nightmare that separated him from glory.</p>

  <h2>🥉 Rammy Firelords � (Babatunde Onasanya) – <span class="highlight">2462 points</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Babatunde Onasanya’s</strong> Rammy Firelords lit up the early season with fire, flame, and flair but by GW38, the fire became... more of a flicker.</p>

  <h2>😲 SMITH FC (WF Smith) – <span class="highlight">2451 points</span></h2>
  <p><strong>WF Smith’s</strong> SMITH FC, hailed pre-season as the Guardiola of the group, finished a humbling <strong>4th</strong>. Even Arsenal would say, “Ouch, that’s harsh.”</p>

  <h2>💬 Special Announcement from the Admin's Desk</h2>
  <p>And finally... to everyone who thought the admin, <strong>4-IN-A-ROW FC (Olaoluwa Onabowale)</strong>, would get relegated <em>shame on you!</em> Not only did he survive, he did it while running the league, fixing deadlines, and watching his transfer plans crash every Saturday at 10:59 AM. Some say he was managing his FPL team on the same laptop he used to run FIFA simulations. That’s what you call multitasking, folks. 🎮📊</p>

  <h2>🫡 Honourable Mentions</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Aügustlin CF (Ben August)</strong> Quietly consistent. The FPL equivalent of a Toyota Corolla.</li>
    <li><strong>ADX FC (Oluwatobiloba Adeneye)</strong> Finished 6th, but #1 in vibes and emotional support for others.</li>
    <li><strong>TIDJANE (Tijani Fawaz)</strong> Tried. That’s all we can ask for.</li>
    <li><strong>SLEEMY FC (Oyelade Samsudeen)</strong> 8th place, but definitely top 3 in banter and wild -8s.</li>
    <li><em> No Arsenal fans in the top 5 not surprising really. Just like their football club in real life… all hype, no trophies. Maybe next year, lads.</em></li>
  </ul>


  <h2>📅 What’s Next?</h2>
  <p>Super BANTER Liga 4.0 is just around the corner. Will Mayowa defend his title? Will Dreamz FC finally load properly? Will SMITH FC recover from this traumatic downfall?</p>
  <p>All we know is... we’ll be back, and the banter will be better.</p>
