  <h1>🏆 Super BANTER Liga 3.0 Ends in SHOCK, TEARS & THUNDER!</h1>

  <p>After 38 grueling Gameweeks of captaincy disasters, differential heartbreaks, and the occasional bench boost betrayal, the curtains have finally closed on the chaos that was <strong>Super BANTER Liga 3.0</strong> and what a finish it was!</p>

  <h2>👑 Champion of Chaos: High Tension⚡️ (Mayowa O’tobiloba) – <span class="highlight">2511 points</span></h2>
  <p>Let’s give a standing ovation (or at least a polite slow clap) to <strong>Mayowa O’tobiloba</strong>, whose team <strong>High Tension⚡️</strong> lived up to its name by taking the title with a solid <strong>2511 points</strong>. Legend has it he captained Haaland on every right week and somehow avoided the infamous Luke Shaw "1-point-and-injury" curse.</p>

  <h2>🥈 Dreamz FC� (Dreamz Of Ng) – <span class="highlight">2492 points</span></h2>
  <p>Coming in second with <strong>2492 points</strong> was <strong>Dreamz Of Ng</strong>. He dreamt big, he played hard but in the end, it was a 19-point nightmare that separated him from glory.</p>

  <h2>🥉 Rammy Firelords � (Babatunde Onasanya) – <span class="highlight">2462 points</span></h2>
  <p><strong>Babatunde Onasanya’s</strong> Rammy Firelords lit up the early season with fire, flame, and flair but by GW38, the fire became... more of a flicker.</p>

  <h2>😲 SMITH FC (WF Smith) – <span class="highlight">2451 points</span></h2>
  <p><strong>WF Smith’s</strong> SMITH FC, hailed pre-season as the Guardiola of the group, finished a humbling <strong>4th</strong>. Even Arsenal would say, “Ouch, that’s harsh.”</p>

  <h2>💬 Special Announcement from the Admin's Desk</h2>
  <p>And finally... to everyone who thought the admin, <strong>4-IN-A-ROW FC (Olaoluwa Onabowale)</strong>, would get relegated <em>shame on you!</em> Not only did he survive, he did it while running the league, fixing deadlines, and watching his transfer plans crash every Saturday at 10:59 AM. Some say he was managing his FPL team on the same laptop he used to run FIFA simulations. That’s what you call multitasking, folks. 🎮📊</p>

	<h2>🫡 Honourable Mentions</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Aügustlin CF (Ben August)</strong> – Quietly consistent. The FPL equivalent of a Toyota Corolla. Also crowned <strong>Banter H2H Winner</strong> 🏆.</li>
	  <li><strong>ADX FC (Oluwatobiloba Adeneye)</strong> – Finished 6th, but definitely top 3 in banter and wild -8s.</li>
	  <li><strong>TIDJANE (Tijani Fawaz)</strong> – Tried. That’s all we can ask for.</li>
	  <li><strong>SLEEMY FC (Oyelade Samsudeen)</strong> – 8th place, but #1 in vibes and emotional support for others.</li>
	  <li><strong>High Tension⚡️ (Mayowa O’tobiloba)</strong> – Not only league winner, but also took home the <strong>FPL All Stars Trophy</strong> 🏆. Man’s collecting silverware like he's Pep.</li>
	  <li><strong>Rammy Firelords (Babatunde Onasanya)</strong> – Grabbed the <strong>Royals Cup</strong> 🏆. Fire on and off the pitch!</li>
	  <li><strong>FANTASY 11 (Olabanji David)</strong> – Won the <strong>SBL Cup</strong> 🏆 but still got relegated. Cup in one hand, tears in the other. </li>
	  <li><em> No Arsenal fans in the top 5 not surprising really. Just like their football club in real life… all hype, no trophies. Maybe next year, lads.</em></li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>✈️ Relegations – Time to Pack Your Bags, Lads</h2>
	<p>Some say the bottom of the table is a lonely place. We say it’s where dreams go to die and FPL captains mysteriously stop working. These brave managers gave it their all — or at least gave <em>something</em> — but sadly, the fantasy gods had other plans.</p>

	<p>The following have officially been <strong>relegated to Fpl All Stars (Championship)</strong>:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>⚡️ <strong>Lasgunned FC</strong> (Gideon Ashogbon) – More like <em>Lasgunned Down FC</em>.</li>
	  <li><strong>Big Layo</strong> (Jesulayo Ajayi) – Big name, big expectations… small points.</li>
	  <li><strong>phoenixxx</strong> (Cidy Okoye) – Tried to rise from the ashes, but stayed in the fire.</li>
	  <li><strong>FC De Fela</strong> (Olumide Kolawole) – Afrobeat legend, FPL struggler.</li>
	  <li><strong>FANTASY 11</strong> (Olabanji David) – The only fantasy here was finishing mid-table.</li>
	  <li><strong>Rotimi_Bully</strong> (Oluwatosin Rotimi) – Got bullied by the fixture list.</li>
	  <li><strong>SPICE FC</strong> (Olabode Abass) – Needed more spice, brought bland rice instead.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>🚀 Promotions – Welcome to the Big League!</h2>
	<p>While some were packing their bags, these lot were punching their ticket to the top. These managers absolutely smashed the Championship and now rise into the elite <strong>FPL All Stars ✨ (Royals)</strong> tier.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Dreamz FC�</strong> (Dreamz Of Ng) – 2nd place and now promoted? This guy’s everywhere.</li>
	  <li><strong>Baby Birkin</strong> (Millie Plain) – Light work for the King of clean sheets and chaos.</li>
	  <li><strong>garneT</strong> (Dieko Adegoke) – Sharp, polished, and promoted like a true gem.</li>
	  <li><strong>Screwysanta007</strong> (Peters Gabriel) – Dropped gifts all season long… for himself.</li>
	  <li><strong>MACKCAMS FC</strong> (Mackson Charles) – The Mac is back and Premier League ready.</li>
	  <li><strong>Orhlarmz D FC</strong> (Oladotun Adedayo) – From unknown to unstoppable.</li>
	  <li><strong>BluesFC</strong> (Idris Oshin) – The only blue that didn’t bottle the season.</li>
	  <li><strong>YungChaLee</strong> (Yung Cha Lee) – Promoted with vibes.</li>
	  <li><strong>WesleyFC</strong> (Daniel Wabara) – He’s in. He’s Wesley. He’s ready.</li>
	  <li><strong>SDRAGON FC</strong> (Oluwaranti Ilesanmi) – Breathed fire on the Championship. Roars into the Royals.</li>
	</ul>

  <h2>📅 What’s Next?</h2>
  <p>Super BANTER Liga 4.0 is just around the corner. Will Mayowa defend his title? Will Dreamz FC finally load properly? Will SMITH FC recover from this traumatic downfall?</p>
  <p>All we know is... we’ll be back, and the banter will be better.</p>
